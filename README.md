[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/branham-player/indexer/_apis/build/status/branham-player.indexer%20(1)?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/branham-player/indexer/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=develop) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ec56f20e947048bfa625922e210fe0fb)](https://www.codacy.com/app/branham-player/indexer?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=branham-player/indexer&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A parser which indexes unstructured collections of data representing William Branham's complete sermon library and structures them for loading into a data ingester.

This project is part of a three-part system which collectively stores, indexes, and then outputs a collection of sermons as JSON files:

1. [Original Sources](https://github.com/branham-player/original-sources): Sermon metadata from various online data sources
1. **[Indexer](https://github.com/branham-player/indexer): This project, takes the information from the above source and processes it as output into the next source**
1. [Golden Dataset](https://github.com/branham-player/golden-dataset): JSON files which are generated by the indexer and manually uploaded to the repository

## Run this Project

To run this project and generate the intended output, you will need the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once that is installed, run these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/branham-player/indexer.git
git clone https://github.com/branham-player/original-sources.git

cd indexer
npm install
npm run all
```

The result of a successful execution is the presence of three new files in the root folder:

- `full.json`: A complete dataset which contains all of the information the program could gather from the original sources
- `condensed.json`: A shortened version of the `full.json` file which contains the most essential pieces of information for the everyday user
- `months.json`: Counts the number of years and months which are present in `full.json`
